        Bionic Reading is a method that facilitates the reading process by
        guiding the eyes through the text. It works by highlighting the
        beginning of each word, which helps the brain to quickly grasp the
        overall meaning. This technique is designed to improve reading speed and
        comprehension, making it easier for people to absorb information.
